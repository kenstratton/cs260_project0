## ▼ five topics related to computing that interest you
1. Trie : useful data structure to search a specific key from a set. I may employ it when implementing a searching bar in a webpage.<br>
2. Dictionary : C++ also has the same data structure such as map. map stores a <key, value> form, and a value is seacheable easily with a key.<br>
3. Session data : (e.g. python's requests library) helps storing login info of a user. I'm planning to understand further about how it works.<br>
4. Dynamic Programming Algorithm : according to the website, it seems a high level programer can provide solutions with the technique. http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/<br>
5. How to organize big data : it seems many company use big data storage software (e.g. NoSQL, Apache Hadoop). What I could only come up with was using a excel sheet.<br>

## ▼ five topics that are difficult related to computer or computing
 1. Object-oriented programing : I feel difficult to manage codes as simplly as possible when using the idea. (e.g. when 100% unrelated classes have methods that work same.)<br>
 2. Object-oriented programing(data) : When deciding a data structure, there can be difficulty about what kind properties a object needs, how classes interact with one another, and so on.<br>
 3. C++ : I've been using comparatively easy language like Ruby, so I anticipate it would take long to be familiar with C++ notation.<br>
 4. API : I'm trying to introduce credit card payment API to a sample of electronic commerce website, but I'm yet to get to understand.<br>
 5. Asyncronous data trasmission : I often use ajax (javascript does data communication without http) to change a part of page layout, but it has a limit of data to handle without http communication.<br>
